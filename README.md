# SynthUtil
Audio utilities for voice generation tasks

![alt text](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Athena-6/SynthUtil/main/example.png)

**Introduction of Functions:**
> Generates generic* .lip files for a whole directory of .wav files based on matching integer durations from 1 to 30 seconds

> Edits .csv files generated for xVASynth, able to batch replace words and/or group lines by voice type

> Preprocessing (CPU-based smoothing and resampling) audio for Creation Kit .lip generation (Fixes associated Creation Kit errors and crashes during lip generation)

*The .lip files generated are *generic* and not as perfect as ones generated by Creation Kit so please do try to use that first.

I will try to add more functionality in the future, whatever seems to help me in my personal workflows.
